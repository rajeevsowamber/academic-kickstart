# The Story
---
The theme of social improvement is what my peers and I pondered one afternoon. We found that there was a difficulty in connecting individuals to volunteer positions in their area which catered towards their personal interests and skills. Thus, we began our design journey to create an effective yet functional mobile application to encourage individuals to volunteer using Volunteer Book.

# Requirements
---
The first step in our design process was to outline the requirements of the mobile application which were categorized into three types: Functional, Data and Environmental requirements. The functional requirements were fundamental and focused on the goal of the mobile application, for example the user should be able to filter volunteer opportunities based on user preferences. Data requirements specified the data needed to be stored in the volunteer application such as a userâ€™s profile information. Finally, environmental requirements show the circumstances in which the mobile application can operate, for example the user must be connected to Wi-Fi and/or cell phone reception.

**Initial Sketches**
After outlining the requirements of the projects, I continued onto creating initial sketches of the mobile application. To initiate a volunteer opportunity, the user would be able to filter their results and find a post which matches their preference, time availability and location.

**Low Fidelity Wireframes**

Using Balsamiq, low fidelity wireframes were created to have a visual and layout of how the mobile application may look. 
I decided to include an "Add Oportunity" button to the top navigation bar so it was easily accessible for users to create positings with minimal effort. The usage of an icon rather than words helped aid user recognition.

Clicking one of the search results will expand the post on the same page and will provide the user with a short description of the volunteer opportunity. This was an important feature to include to provide the user with more information on the posting efficiently, rather than being redirected to a different page each click. This would allow the user to scroll through postings since they can expand and collapse each posting with one click.
